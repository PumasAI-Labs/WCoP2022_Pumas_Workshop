# WCoP2022 Pumas Workshop

This repository holds the code and data for the [Virtual Workshop on Pharmacometric modelling & simulation with Pumas.jl](https://wcop2022.org/event/wcop-2022-workshop-information-form/) at WCoP 2022.

## About the Workshop

This workshop is designed for beginners and relatively experienced individuals dealing with clinical pharmacology related data analytics in their day to day work. Individuals interested in performing Non-compartmental analysis on their clinical data or use basic or advanced non-linear mixed effects models to capture the variability in drug pharmacokinetics or response and the contribution of covariate effects and/or simulate new dosing scenarios or clinical trials will find this workshop interesting.

## Workshop overview

Pharmaceutical Modelling and Simulation (Pumas) is a domain-specific extension of the Julia differential equation solver libraries for performing analyses of pharmacometric models. We will start by showing users how to implement PK/PD models with complex dosing schedules and incorporating population models. Then we will turn to the process of estimating population parameters from data. Next, the capability of Pumas to perform common pre-clinical and clinical data analytics work flows such as Non-compartmental analysis (NCA), In vitro- in vivo correlation (IVIVC), Bio-equivalence (BE) and Clinical Trial Design (CTS) will be introduced. This workshop will be a mix of demonstration and hands-on work where participants will be able to download the Pumas software and perform the analysis in real-time. At the end of the workshop, participants will have an overview of the Pumas toolkit and its utility in modern age computing.

## Workshop Learning Objectives 

At the end of the workshop, participants will:

- Gain an overview of the Pumas modelling ecosystem
- Learn how to perform Non-compartmental Analysis in Pumas
- Learn how to simulate using non-linear mixed effects models in Pumas
- Learn the different estimation methods and perform data analysis using Pumas NLME
- Learn how to perform post-processing of results for reporting
